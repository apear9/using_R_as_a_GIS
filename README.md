# using_R_as_a_GIS

This is a repository containing an .Rmd file to produce the slides for my seminar "Using R as a GIS: a crash course in open source geoprocessing and cartography". This seminar took place on 31 July, 2017, and was organised by the Quantative Applied Spatial Ecology group at the Queensland University of Technology. 

The seminar was recorded by Tim Macuga from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS). The recording has been posted to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyF8YpBWQIM&t=2334s.
