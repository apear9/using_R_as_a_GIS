# using_R_as_a_GIS

## Description

This is a repository containing an .Rmd file to produce the slides for my seminar "Using R as a GIS: a crash course in open source cartography and geoprocessing". This seminar took place on 31 July, 2017, and was organised by the Quantative Applied Spatial Ecology group at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Note: this is a slightly updated and extended version of the slides, which I used for a guest lecture for EVB222: Spatial Analysis and Modelling Practice at QUT in October of the same year.

The seminar was recorded by Tim Macuga from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS). The recording has been posted to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyF8YpBWQIM&t=2334s.
